## 2. Description

### 2.1 Problem

In a fast-paced TV, Film, and Video production environment **Video Editors** often receive stakeholder's notes in a **text format**. The notes would normally include a timestamp and a comment on what needs to be changed in a free form like:

```
1:02 switch angle here
14:05 replace this shot
```

In the case of Documentary films or long interviews, the length of the footage can be very long. And so do the notes.

### 2.2 Solution

Instead of manually selecting these clips in Video Editing Software or copy-pasting the one timecode at a time this script automatically adds comments to a single clip or compound clip in a form of markers inside FinalCut Pro based on stakeholder's notes, therefore, increasing productivity, precision, and eliminating mistakes. 

Once added, the markers stay attached to the actual clips no matter where those clips get moved. This eliminates the need for Video Editors to make edits from behind in order to preserve timings specified in stakeholders' notes. 

### 2.3 Motivation behind the project

I first created this workflow when I was Directing and Video Editing TV mini-series. Since deadlines were extremely tight I was looking at every opportunity to speed up the delivery times while maintaining high quality. I later used it for commercial Videography projects. This solution fits my workflow very well and has proven to be very useful.

### 2.4 Development history
It was originally built simply by using a stack of **regular expressions** executed in the TextSoap.app along with some operations in Excel and copy-pasting the code manually. Later most of the steps were combined in a single Python script that is presented here.

## 3. Technologies Used
* **`Python 3.9.4`**, compatible with `Python 2.7` and above
* **`datetime`** integrated module to work with date and time
* **`re`** integrated regular expression operations module
* **`os`** a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality


## 4. Installation

Download **`text_to_video_markers.py`** file from this GitHub repository.

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 Prepare and export .fcpxml file

#### 5.1.1 Create new project

In FinalCut Pro create a `New Project` and load clips into the timeline. In a sample project, I duplicated the same clips to make the project over one hour long.

#### 5.1.2 Create and compound clip and 

Now `Select all`, choose `File -> New -> Compound Clip`, and make at least one cut of the newly created compound clip.

![fcp new compound clip](png/comp.png)

#### 5.1.3 Export XML

Choose `File -> Export XML`. Rename it to **`clip.fcpxml`** and save it in the same folder with `text_to_video_markers.py` file.

![finalcut export fcpxml](png/xmlexp.png)

### 5.2 Prepare .txt file

#### 5.2.1 Write text instructions

**Write instructions** on where you want to place markers. The text:

- Must contain at least **one timecode in a line** either in `hh:mm:ss` or `mm:ss` format.
- Lines **without timecodes** will be moved to a previous line.
- Lines with **more than one timecodes** will use the first one and discard others.
- The **text** will be inserted as **markers' names**.

Here is a **sample** provided in this project:

```
0:01 camera shake here
music louder? 
00:2 a bit to dark here
0:3 try to change angle for 0:14 sec
from 03:07 cut out until 3:20 
04:17 fantastic shot!
4:31 add transition
1:4:40 add titles here
01:04:48 fade to black
```

As you can see the formatting can be quite loose.

#### 5.2.2 Rename and move .txt file

Save the text as `videomarkers.txt`, and move the file into the same folder with `clip.fcpxml` and `text_to_video_markers.py`.

### 5.3 Launch Python script

Open **Terminal.app**. Type `python`, add `space`, then drag and drop `text_to_video_markers.py` and press `Return`.

![run python script with terminal](png/trm3.png)

Alternatively you can instal the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/macOS). Right-click on `text_to_video_markers.py` file and choose `Open with -> Python Launcher.app`.

![open python file with python launcher](png/pylaunch.png)

Either method will run the script and create `export.fcpxml` file in the same folder.
### 5.4 Open export.fcpxml with FinalCut Pro

Select newly created `export.fcpxml` file and `Open with -> FinalCut Pro`. Upon opening choose the original library, then `Keep Both`. This will create the second project with `your_original_name_1` that will include all the edits specified in `videomarkers.txt`.

**That's it!** We have just automatically created markers on a compound clip inside FinalCut Pro based on human-written text instructions.

## 6. Project Status

The project is: **_complete_**
I am no longer working on it since I am not working for TV any longer. But if you have some ideas or want me to modify something [contact me](#contact) and we should be able to collaborate.

## 7. Known Limitations
* Tested in **Mac OS** only
* The input .fcpxml file must have at least one **marker**.
* Input files must be named **`clip.fcpxml`** and **`videomarkers.txt`**.
* All three files (`text_to_video_markers.py`, `clip.fcpxml`, `videomarkers.txt`) must be located in the **same folder**.
## 8. Room for Improvement
* **Testing** and logging the issues.
* Adding support for compatibility with **multiple** distinct compound and regular clips.
* Making this python script into an **executable file**.
* **Developing GUI** to be able to specify .txt and .fcpxml input files with any name and location.
* Building a **web app**.
